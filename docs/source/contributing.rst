Contributing to Hydrant
=======================

Hydrant is a relatively young project that can use plenty of help from anyone.
Things listed here are rough guidelines, but are a good starting direction.

If you have any questions, feel free to email jeff at jeffhui.net with some
subject talking about Hydrant.

.. _bugs:

Filing Bugs
-----------

Found a bug? File an issue on the `GitHub page <hydrant_issues>`_. When you
write on up, be sure to include:

    - Steps to reproduce the behavior in question. Small code examples that
      demonstrate is are excellent!
    - Expected behavior, what expected to happen.
    - Actual behavior, what actually happened.

These points are mostly a starting conversation about the issue.

Contributing Code
-----------------

Code is welcomed, although unlike application code, is subjected to more
scrutiny. Since the most expense part about software is maintaince, so
pull requests require the following:

    - Tests that can verify the regression (if a bug) or validate a new feature
    - If its a new feature, documentation explaining the new feature.

It's good to keep in mind the original :doc:`design <design>` of Hydrant when
writing the code.

Feedback about the pull request or code contributes are never towards the
contributor, but instead towards improving the code.
