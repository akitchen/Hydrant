/*! Constructs a mapper that maps properties from source objectÂ to a destination object

 *  key value.
 *
 *  The destinationClass is created using [[[destinationClass alloc] init] mutableCopy]. The

 *
 *  @param destinationAccessor the property hint to store key value.
 *  @param sourceClass the source object type. This is used when generating a reverse mapper.
 *  @param destinationClass the destination object type. This is created by the mapper.
 *  @returns a mapper that maps properties from the source object to the destination object.
 *  @see HYDMapObjectPath for a similar mapper which uses key paths.
